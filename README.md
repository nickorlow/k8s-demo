# Kubernetes Demo
A demo for CS 360V at the University of Texas at Austin

This is a demo that sets up a Kubernetes cluster using KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) and deploys a demo site (source code for this is in the `./demo-site` directory)

This demo site can be used do demonstrate Kubernetes' ability to manage resource allocation in terms of memory and CPU, shows how k8s does rolling 
restarts, and how Kubernetes manages failed (crashed) pods and nodes.
